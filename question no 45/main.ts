// 45. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function storeCarInfo(manufacturer: string, modelName: string, ...options: [string, any][]) {
    let carInfo: { [key: string]: any } = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        modelName: modelName
    };

    // Iterate over the options and add them to the carInfo object
    options.forEach(option => {
        const [key, value] = option;
        carInfo[key] = value;
    });

    return carInfo;
}

// Call the function with required information and additional name-value pairs
let car = storeCarInfo("Toyota", "Camry",["color", "blue"], ["year", 2022]);

// Print the object returned by the function
console.log(car);
